# Weisrc Present

Hello internet! This repository is just for personal presentations using [slidev](https://sli.dev/) mainly for school. I am using slidev because it is minimalistic and also because I don't like drag-and-drop interfaces.

This is not private because I want to use GitHub Pages.

# Content

- [Classical Aesthetics](https://weisrc.github.io/present/classical-aesthetics) will cover my formal analysis on The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci.

# License

MIT, even though it ain't truly software :)
